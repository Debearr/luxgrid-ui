## Vision
LuxGrid UI provides Fortune-500 polish, accessibility, and modular components across all LuxGrid products. Inspired by Tesla Hub sleekness and Tom Ford luxury aesthetics, this system ensures consistency, speed, and trust.

## Brand DNA
- **Minimalist**: Clean grid, sharp typography, intentional whitespace.  
- **Luxury**: Subtle gradients, refined shadows, confident interactions.  
- **Accessible**: WCAG-compliant color contrasts and keyboard navigation.  
- **Emotional Triggers**: Seamless animations that evoke elegance.  
- **Gamification**: Delightful micro-interactions for onboarding and user retention.

## Technical Stack
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Storybook (for component previews)

## Next Steps
1. Initialize `package.json` with dependencies.  
2. Add Tailwind + PostCSS config.  
3. Create `src/components` folder with first component (`Button`).  
4. Add Storybook for component documentation.  
5. Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD for quality checks.  
6. Zero-Touch Deployment: run `npm run automation:setup` and configure secrets `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN` in repository settings to enable the AI Council → PR → Vercel pipeline.
