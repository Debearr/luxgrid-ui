## Vision
LuxGrid UI provides Fortune-500 polish, accessibility, and modular components across all LuxGrid products. Inspired by Tesla Hub sleekness and Tom Ford luxury aesthetics, this system ensures consistency, speed, and trust.

## Brand DNA
- **Minimalist**: Clean grid, sharp typography, intentional whitespace.  
- **Luxury**: Subtle gradients, refined shadows, confident interactions.  
- **Accessible**: WCAG-compliant color contrasts and keyboard navigation.  
- **Emotional Triggers**: Seamless animations that evoke elegance.  
- **Gamification**: Delightful micro-interactions for onboarding and user retention.

## Next Steps

2. Add Tailwind + PostCSS config.  
3. Create `src/components` folder with first component (`Button`).  
4. Add Storybook for component documentation.  
5. Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD for quality checks.

## One-Click VC Pipeline (Evidence-Driven)
- Prompt template: see `docs/oneclick-vc-pipeline.md` for the evidence-based review, ROI-ranked execution plan, stakeholder deliverables, validation gates, and quality enforcement.
- Context rules: configured in `.oneclickrc.json` to improve semantic relevance (always-include, business logic, infra, and deprioritized files).

Validate outputs locally:
- Generate output JSON with your pipeline and save as `output.json`.
- Run: `npm run vc:validate` to validate against `docs/oneclick-vc-output.schema.json`.

Use the prompt template with your one-click evaluation flow to generate investor-ready, executable outputs.
