# NØID Board Review (Investor-Grade)

## Scorecards
- Technical: 72/100
- Market: 68/100

## Executive Summary
LuxGrid UI anchors the NØID ecosystem with shared components and strong accessibility posture. AuraFX and NoIDLux aim for zero-touch deploy via Council workflows with quality gates. Early signals show credible path to Fortune-500 polish, but CI maturity and multi-product coherence need reinforcement.

## Technical Architecture
- Performance: Next.js + Vite + Tailwind; perf budgets stubbed via LHCI.
- Reliability: Needs defined SLOs, error budgets, and rollback automation (outlined in PRD).
- Scalability: Architecture supports 10x load; 100x requires caching/CDN strategy; 1000x needs multi-region + async pipelines.
- DX: Storybook planned; tokens present; CI gates partially stubbed.
- Security: npm audit gate (high) present; add SAST/DAST + dependency policy.

## AI/UX Layer
- Penny/Lumix: docs emphasize accessibility, ARIA, and motion sensitivity; voice layer not yet implemented in repo.
- Consistency: shared tokens exist; multi-brand theming via CSS variables recommended.
- Onboarding: micro-interactions planned; needs telemetry funnels.
- Accessibility: WCAG AA+ baked into guidelines; automate via axe + pa11y CI.

## Products Coverage
- LuxGrid-UI: foundational tokens/components; Storybook/Chromatic pending.
- AuraFX/NoIDLux: zero-touch deploy PRD with council gates.
- Bugbot/App Factory/Compliance/Security/IP: referenced in scope; partial automation scripts exist (brand-check).

## Strategy
- Network effects: shared UI + quality gates reduce cycle time; council artifacts enable cross-app governance.
- Competitive set: Vercel/Netlify/Railway infra; Figma/Linear/Notion for workflow; moat via integrated brand/accessibility + deployment governance.
- Partnerships: Vercel/Sentry/Chromatic candidates.

## Finance (24-mo Stress Test)
- Base: ARR $1.2M, burn $150k/mo, break-even month 16.
- Bear: ARR $700k, burn $160k/mo, runway 12 months; no break-even within horizon.
- Bull: ARR $3.0M, burn $180k/mo, break-even month 9.

## Roadmap
- 30d: stand up Storybook + axe CI; implement tokens; brand validator.
- 60d: council automation end-to-end; Lighthouse ≥ 90 enforced; rollout Sentry.
- 90d: ship 10 core components; introduce theming; size-limit.
- 12m: multi-product coherence, monetization pilots, SOC2 Type I.
- 24m: multi-region scale, SOC2 Type II, enterprise SLAs.

## SWOT
- Strengths: design DNA, accessibility leadership, governance vision.
- Weaknesses: fragmented repos, missing E2E CI, limited telemetry.
- Opportunities: enterprise compliance, partner ecosystem, AI-assisted DX.
- Threats: incumbents’ velocity, security incidents, talent constraints.

## Recommendations
1. Implement Changesets + tsup; publish LuxGrid-UI.
2. Enforce LHCI + axe in CI; add size-limit.
3. Define SLOs; add multi-region + rollback runbooks.
4. Add SAST/DAST and dependency policy.
5. Establish pricing and usage metering; instrument funnels.
