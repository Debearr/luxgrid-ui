# NØID Board Review (Investor-Grade)\n\n## Scorecards\n- Technical: 72/100\n- Market: 68/100\n\n## Executive Summary\nLuxGrid UI anchors the NØID ecosystem with shared components and strong accessibility posture. AuraFX and NoIDLux aim for zero-touch deploy via Council workflows with quality gates. Early signals show credible path to Fortune-500 polish, but CI maturity and multi-product coherence need reinforcement.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n- Performance: Next.js + Vite + Tailwind; perf budgets stubbed via LHCI.\n- Reliability: Needs defined SLOs, error budgets, and rollback automation (outlined in PRD).\n- Scalability: Architecture supports 10x load; 100x requires caching/CDN strategy; 1000x needs multi-region + async pipelines.\n- DX: Storybook planned; tokens present; CI gates partially stubbed.\n- Security: npm audit gate (high) present; add SAST/DAST + dependency policy.\n\n## AI/UX Layer\n- Penny/Lumix: docs emphasize accessibility, ARIA, and motion sensitivity; voice layer not yet implemented in repo.\n- Consistency: shared tokens exist; multi-brand theming via CSS variables recommended.\n- Onboarding: micro-interactions planned; needs telemetry funnels.\n- Accessibility: WCAG AA+ baked into guidelines; automate via axe + pa11y CI.\n\n## Products Coverage\n- LuxGrid-UI: foundational tokens/components; Storybook/Chromatic pending.\n- AuraFX/NoIDLux: zero-touch deploy PRD with council gates.\n- Bugbot/App Factory/Compliance/Security/IP: referenced in scope; partial automation scripts exist (brand-check).\n\n## Strategy\n- Network effects: shared UI + quality gates reduce cycle time; council artifacts enable cross-app governance.\n- Competitive set: Vercel/Netlify/Railway infra; Figma/Linear/Notion for workflow; moat via integrated brand/accessibility + deployment governance.\n- Partnerships: Vercel/Sentry/Chromatic candidates.\n\n## Finance (24-mo Stress Test)\n- Base: ARR .2M, burn 50k/mo, break-even month 16.\n- Bear: ARR 00k, burn 60k/mo, runway 12 mo without cuts.\n- Bull: ARR .0M, burn 80k/mo, break-even month 9.\n\n## Roadmap\n- 30d: stand up Storybook + axe CI; implement tokens; brand validator.\n- 60d: council automation end-to-end; Lighthouse ≥ 90 enforced; rollout Sentry.\n- 90d: ship 10 core components; introduce theming; size-limit.\n- 12m: multi-product coherence, monetization pilots, SOC2 Type I.\n- 24m: multi-region scale, SOC2 Type II, enterprise SLAs.\n\n## SWOT\n- Strengths: design DNA, accessibility leadership, governance vision.\n- Weaknesses: fragmented repos, missing E2E CI, limited telemetry.\n- Opportunities: enterprise compliance, partner ecosystem, AI-assisted DX.\n- Threats: incumbents’ velocity, security incidents, talent constraints.\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Implement Changesets + tsup; publish LuxGrid-UI.\n2. Enforce LHCI + axe in CI; add size-limit.\n3. Define SLOs; add multi-region + rollback runbooks.\n4. Add SAST/DAST and dependency policy.\n5. Establish pricing and usage metering; instrument funnels.\n
